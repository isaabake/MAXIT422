MAXIT422
========

MAXIT testing assignment 1 for CptS 422

Questions
---------
What types of defects did you find? 
I found a defect in isGameOver() where I wasn't checking if the current node was selected since you cannot make a move on the selected node.

Did you test the boundaries of conditions?
The condition for each function was always the game's board. I used a 2x2 board because it could exhaust all the branches and statements in the functions without getting messy in initialization.

Note:
I didn't create a unit test for the MAXIT.Run() function because it has no inputs or outputs. It mearly calls the other functions and gets input from the user.



Time Log
-------------
8-26: 30 min Analyzing problem
8-26: 1 hr developing game
8-27: 30 min developing game
8-29: 1hr 30 min developing game
9-9: 1hr developing game
9-11: 30 min developing game
9-11: 5 hrs writing tests

Analysis: .5 hrs 	5%
Dev: 4.5 hrs		45%
Test: 5 hrs			50%

This project didn't take much analysis for me so it didn't match the 40-20-40 rule. I did do a fair amount of testing though which probably makes up for part of it.
